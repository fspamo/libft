# Libft

## Description

**Libft** is a foundational project in the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to create a personal C library by reimplementing a subset of standard C library functions, as well as additional utility functions that will be reused in future projects.

Through this project, students learn:
- Low-level memory manipulation
- String handling
- Defensive programming in C
- Proper use of headers, Makefiles, and static libraries

The result is a reusable static library (`libft.a`) that provides reliable, well-tested helper functions.
